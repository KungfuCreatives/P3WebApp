                        	The PMP® was initiated in 1984 to recognize an individual’s demonstrated understanding of the<br />
                        	knowledge and skills to lead and direct project teams and to deliver results within the constraints of<br />
                        	schedule, budget, and resources. Candidates for the PMP® credential ensure that all of the aspects of the<br />
                        	project plan are executed and that progress and variances are properly addressed and communicated.<br />
                        	They are responsible for all aspects of the project for the life of the project and not only lead and direct<br />
                        	the project, but also oversee project team members.</p>
                    	<p>The course is based on the nine Knowledge Areas of the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge® and the five process groups - Initiating, Planning, Executing, Controlling, and Closing. Professional Responsibility will also be reviewed. This course will also provide attendees with practical information and skill enhancing tips and techniques that can be applied immediately to the project work environment. </p>
                    	<p>
                            At the completion of the course you will have a greater understanding of the PMBOK® Guide and how to effectively use the document for study as well as practical application to your projects, possess the necessary information to successfully pass the PMP® exam. Our study strategy will increase your comprehension and retention of the key elements of each knowledge area ensuring you are prepared to pass the detailed exam and earn your PMP® Credentials.
